# AI-Powered Virtual Chemistry Lab

## Overview
The AI-Powered Virtual Chemistry Lab is an interactive platform that leverages machine learning techniques to analyze chemical reactions, classify inorganic compounds, and simulate hazardous reactions using reinforcement learning. The application provides an intuitive Gradio UI for user interaction.

## Features
- **Volumetric Analysis**: AI-assisted analysis of chemical solutions.
- **Qualitative & Quantitative Analysis**: Identification and measurement of chemical compounds.
- **Chemical Reaction Simulations**: Simulate and predict reaction outcomes.
- **Hazardous Reactions Handling**: Reinforcement learning-based simulations of top 25 dangerous chemical reactions.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow & Keras (Supervised Learning for Organic Chemistry Analysis)
- Scikit-learn (Unsupervised Learning for Inorganic Chemistry Classification)
- Stable Baselines3 & Gym (Reinforcement Learning for Hazardous Reaction Simulation)
- Gradio (User Interface)
- Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
